Brown eyes (bb) parent 2: In this model, the hazel eye trait (bb) is dominant over pure brown (bb) or green/blue (bb) eyes. The complex genetic process involved in determining eye colors involves the following factors: Brown, hazel/green, blue and albino eyes as seen by most of the tritanopic “normal” population. Hazel eyes are a combination of brown, green, and amber tones, resulting in a unique and variable eye color. A single copy of the gene for hazel eyes is enough to make your eye color this shade. Gray eyes are a lighter variation of blue eyes and are typically associated with individuals who have low melanin levels in their irises. Your genes control how much melanin pigmentation your iris produces—the thin, circular structure in your eye that gives it its color.
